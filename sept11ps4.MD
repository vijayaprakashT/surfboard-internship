# PROBLEM SOLVE 4

## TOWER OF HANOI:

1.CONDITIONS:
         1.you can't place a disk on small disk.
         2.you can carry only one disk at a time .
         3.with all this condition you should shift all needles from one condition to another condition.


1.STEPS TO SOLVE :
            1.from needle 1 take the topmost disk(1) and shift it to 3rd needle.
            2.take the next topmost disk(2) and shift it to needle 2.
            3.take the topmost disk(1) from needle 3 and shift it to disk 2. place it above disk (2).
            4.From needle1.take the topmost disk(3) and shift to needle 3.
            5.From needle2.take topmost disk(1).shift to needle 3.place it above disk(3).
            6.From needle3.Take topmost disk(1).shift to needle 1 place it above disk(4).
            7.From needle 3 take topmost disk (1) and shift to needle 2.
            8.From needle 1 take topmost disk(2).shift to needle 3.place it above disk(3).
            9.from needle 2 take disk(1) shift to needle 3 .place it above disk 2.
            10.from needle 1.take disk(4) shift to needle 2.
            11.from needle 3.Take topmost disk(1) shift to needle 1.
            12.from needle3.take disk (2) shift to needle 2 place it above disk4.
            13.from needle 1 .take disk(1) shift to needle 2.place it above disk 2 and 4.
            14.from needle 3 .take disk(3) shift to needle 1.
            15.from needle 2 take disk(1) shift to needle 1 and place it above disk(3).
            16.from needle2 take topmost disk(2).shift to needle 3.
            17.From needle1 take disk 3 shift to needle2 and place it above disk 4.
            18.from needle 3 take topmost disk (1) shift to needle 1.
            19.from needle 3 take topmost disk (2). shift it to needle 3 and place it above disk 3 and 4.
            20.from needle 1.take disk 1 shift it to needle 2.

conclusion:  finally we have shifted all disk to another needle which satisfying the conditions.
