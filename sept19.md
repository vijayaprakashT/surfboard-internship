During my internship, we had an insightful discussion about various aspects of languages, focusing on syntax and semantics. These two components are fundamental in understanding how a language functions, whether it's a programming language or a spoken language.

## SYNTAX and SEMANTICS:
      1.SYNTAX:
              1.Syntax refers to the structure or arrangement of symbols and tokens in a language. It's like the grammar rules that dictate how sentences or code must be written.

              2.In programming, syntax defines how code should be formatted for it to be compiled or executed correctly. Similarly, in spoken languages, syntax refers to the correct arrangement of words to form meaningful sentences.
    
      2.SEMANTICS:
                1.Semantics deals with the meaning behind the syntax. It ensures that the sentences or code not only follow the structural rules but also convey a meaningful message.

                2.In programming, it checks whether the syntax does what it's intended to do. In human languages, semantics is the meaning conveyed by a word or sentence.

###  LANGUAGES:

       1.SYMBOLS:
            1.Symbols are individual characters or elements that have specific meanings within a language.

            2.Symbols are alphabets, special characters, numbers.

      1.TOKENS:
              1. tokens are combination of symbol that has meaning in the language.

      1.EXPRESSION:
               1.Its a combination of tokens .
               2.Its valid when the syntax and semantics are followed.


After this we have discussed about the general topic of what is stress and how to manage the stress.

kowsiq bro nicely conveyed about  what is stress and he said its all about how we are handling the situation.

for example : when a person able to solve 2 problems and for him they have assigned to solve 10 problems this could lead to the stress.
so start with single steps like today solve two problems and next day increase with two problem this how you can able to manage the stress .everything is all about how you are breaking down the problems to solve .
