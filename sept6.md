# SEPT 6
>  continued with yesterday  array topics

## ARRAYS:
      1.Array.findindex():
                1.findindex() method is used for find the index which satisfying the condition .if it satisfies it return true or else it return -1.
      2.Array.join():
                1.join() is used for create  and returns new string by concatenating all the elements in array separated by commas or specified separator string

                2.example:
                       const elements = ['g','o','a','t'];

                       console.log(elements.join());


     3.Array.concat():
              1.used to merge two or more array   
              example:

              const elements =['u','c','b'];
              const element = ['o','n','y'];

              const arr = elements.concat(element) ;

    4.Array.string.split():
        1.split() method is used to divide string into substring based on specified separator and output in array format.
        example:

        const a = "apple , banana, cabbage" ;

        console.log(elements.split(",")) ;

    5.Array.splice():
        1.used for adding and removing  elements 
        example:
             let num =[1,2,3,4];
             num.splice(1,3);  2,3,4
             console.num();
    6.Array.slice():
        1. used for implement start and end to execute.
        example:
           let num =[1,2,3,4];
             num.slice(1,3);  2,3,4
             console.num();
    
    7.Array.flat():
        1.creates a new array and concatenate all the sub arrays into array 
        2.sub array depth index starts from 1
        example:
        const = [1,2[3,4[5,6]]]
        console.log


    > after learned all this topics and i tried to implement in simple problem solving question in w3 resources
    and i have learned some commands used in terminals.

### COMMANDS:
         1.some of the commands used in terminal:
             1. :E -> used for delete a file.
             2.:cd -> command.
             3.:saveas -> saving file.
             4. :q -> quit.
             5. :wq -> save changes and quit.
             6.:cd %:p:h -> view/change current working directory.
             7. : i -> insert
             8.ESC -> command (alternate option for 2).
             9. ! -> override.
             10. :e <filename> -> to open a  file.
             11. :u -> undo.
             12.ctrl+r -> redo changes.
             13.:y -> copy a line.
             14.:d-> delete a file.
             15.h -> move to top.
             16. L -> move to bottom .
