## PROBLEM SOLVE 6


During my internship, my mentor  given  problem-solving tasks to improve my logical thinking and programming skills. one of the problem in pdf is to write a program to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using a basic approach.

The goal was to create a function that finds the GCD of two numbers, a and b. The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

CONSTRAINTS: computer doesnt know the multiplication . computer only knows about addition so based on that we have to write a algorithm 

lets breakdown the problem:

                1.create a function gcd(a, b) to accept two numbers as input.
                2.Use a loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to the smaller of a and b.
                3.Check divisibility of both numbers by each number in the loop using the modulus operator (%).
                4.Update the greatest common divisor if both a and b are divisible by the current number.
                5.Return the largest common divisor after the loop completes.
             

Initially, I had some trouble structuring the logic to solve this problem, as finding the greatest divisor of two numbers can be confusing. However, after researching different methods for solving the GCD, I came up with new approach, which I implemented successfully. The task helped me understand how to iterate through numbers and check for divisibility, improving my understanding of loops and conditions.
