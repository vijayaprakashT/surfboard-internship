## INTERNSHIP PROGRAM :

           In kowsik bro class . we have discussed about the last class task which he gave and after this we have discussed about the programming language and language .

           we get to know that we have common in both language there are :

                          1.literature
                          2.alphabets
                          3.grammer.
                          4.punctuation.
                          5.pronounciation.
                          6.terminalogy.
          
          each language designed by someone  to interact with people and it same goes for programming language we will communicate through programming language such as javascript,java etc..,

          computer are doing what we are instructing to them and it perform untill we get to used its useless.computer are always dumb untill we get to use it for purpose.

### PROBLEMS DISCUSSED:

        1.QUESTION 1:
                 1.start 
                 2.set name = surfboard.
                 3.print name .
                 4.add payments to the beginning of the name.
                 5.print name.
                 6.go to step 2 and continue till you print name(surfboard) 5 times.

                 output:
                 surfboard.
                 payment surfboard.
                 surfboard.
                 payment surfboard
                 surfboard.
                 payment surfboard.
            
        2.question2:
             1: Start
             2: Set numberToCheck <- 1001001001001, 12345567891, 559922932941
             3: Remove the last digit
             4: From the last digit multiply each digit by 2
             5: Take each of the products derived and add them together
             6: Reduce the number until you get a single digit
             7: Check if the calculated value is equal to the last digit from Step 3
             8: Decide if the number is valid (If the value is equal, the number is valid.
             Otherwise it is invalid)
             9: Print the validity
             10: Stop

             output:
             1001001001001 = invalid.
             12345567891 = valid.
             559922932941 = valid.
       
        3.question 3:
                1.Start
                2. Set max <- 0
                3. Take a number from the input
                4. Check if number is greater than max, if it is, set max <- number
                5. Goto Step 3, until all given numbers are exhausted
                6. Print max
                7. Stop

                output:
                max=0
                [4,2,3]

                max>4
                max=4

                [4,2,3]
                 max > 2(false)
                 max = 4

                 [4,2,3]
                max > 3(false)
                max = 4.

                4 is max
