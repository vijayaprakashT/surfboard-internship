In today internship , we dont have a internship class  so my mentor told me to study about the express framework 

## EXPRESS FRAMEWORK:
                1.Express is a framework and its used for handling multiple functions request  using routing and middleware function to check whether the access authorized or not.

                2.Its a dependent framework.
                3.framwework means prebuilt structure that helps you build application more easily and quickly.
                4.Its doesn't built in support for connecting to database usually rely on external libraries(collection of prewritten code).

        1.EXPRESS.JSON():
                  1.Its a built in tool helps to server understand and handle data sent in json format.
                  2.json is nothing but object in javascript.
                  3.Syntax rules:
                           1.Data is in name/value pairs.
                           2.Data is separated by commas.
                           3.Curly braces hold objects.
                           4.Square brackets hold array.


after all this i have intsalled the express framework from npm js website using a command for installing  express framework.
command for installation is -> npm i express.

I have implemented the express to create javascript application before that i connected to the server .
my mentor told me to do crud operation using express framework in node js  and while implementing code for express in that process.env.port -> its the environment variable it will adapt to different environments.

I have started to write code for crud operation for employee details.first i have started with create operation
for create operation  we have to use post method to insert an values .

In create i'm going to add employee id ,name ,age ,gender for employee details.

we have to write a function for post method  inside the we have declare varibales and writing a condition which  satisfying the constraints.
