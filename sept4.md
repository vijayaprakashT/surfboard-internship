## **internship program**

we have discussed some logical solving problems based on real scenario and solving  sudoku.

## problem solving:
                  1.understanding the problem
                  2.write the constraints
                  3.operations by statisfying the constraints
                  4. more constraints easier to solve solutions.
                  5.There are problems has no solutions until if the 4 points doesnt work out.

lets get into the each principles for problem solving:
                   1.The process began with understanding the problem, which is the first and most crucial step. If we don’t fully understand what we’re dealing with, it’s impossible to come up with a proper solution.

                   2.The second step was to write down the constraints. Constraints are the rules or limits that must be followed when solving the problem.

                   3.This step involves coming up with possible solutions while ensuring that all the constraints are met. 

                   4.The more constraints a problem has, the easier it becomes to filter out possible solutions because you know what must be avoided.

                   5.if the four points are not satisfied means it has no solutions and there are some problem which has no solution .



> In javascript ,today i have learned let, var,const and what is class,array ,object

### class:
         1.A class in JavaScript is a blueprint for creating objects. It allows you to define properties and methods that can be shared across multiple instances of the class.
         2.you can define methods inside a class, which represent the behaviors or actions the objects can perform. Methods are defined without the function keyword.

#### Array:
        1.Arrays in JavaScript are used to store multiple values in a single variable, which can be accessed by index.
        2. Arrays can store different data types, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays .
        3.Arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is accessed using index 0, the second with index 1, and so on.
        4.Arrays in JavaScript are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, added, or removed after the array is created.
        5.The length property of an array gives the number of elements in the array.

##### Object :
         1.Objects are collections of key-value pairs where each key is a string (or symbol), and each value can be any type .
         2.Objects can have multiple properties, each defined by a key  and a corresponding value.
         3. You can access object properties using dot notation (object.property) or bracket notation.
         4.Objects are mutable, meaning you can add, change, or remove properties after the object is created.
         5.Objects can have methods (functions) as properties, which allow you to define behaviors for that object.


I have learned about the let , var , const in javascript.

1.VAR:
       1.If you create a variable outside of a function, you can use it anywhere in your code.
       2.If you create a variable inside a function, you can only use it within that function.

2.LET:
     1.The variable is only available inside the block {} where you define it.
     2. It  has block scope.

3.CONST :
      1. using const once you assigned a value for that you cant able to reassign the value.
