# SEPT 4

## **internship program**

we have discussed some logical solving problems based on real scenario and solving  sudoku.

## problem solving:
                  1.understanding the problem
                  2.write the constraints
                  3.operations by statisfying the constraints
                  4. more constraints easier to solve solutions.
                  5.There are problems has no solutions until if the 3 points doesnt work out.

> In javascript ,today i have learned let, var,const and what is class,array ,object

### class:
         1.class is like a creating a object  based on that you can perform multiple functions  atlast you can call with the help of objectname using calling method ex: create.objname= new create()

#### Array:
        1.In array you can store  a non primitive datatype in javascript  without specifying the datatype and perform the function.

##### Object :
         1. object is like based on object we will create states and behaviors .
