 I learned about the node.js and crud operations.

 ## NODE-JS :
         1.Node.js is an open source server environment.
         2.Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine.
         3.Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking  Input/Output model. This allows handling multiple requests simultaneously without blocking the execution of other tasks.
         4.Its a cross platform compatibility which allows developers to write it once and deploy it anywhere.
         5.Its not dependent on any operating system software.
         6.Its executes javascript code out of web browser.


### CRUD OPERATIONS:
          1.crud refers to the four basic operations a software application should be able to perform -> create , read, update, delete.
                1.CREATE:
                          1.Create operation is used to create a new data entry  in application .
                          2.without create you cant able to implement any other operations.
                          3.for create , we have to use post method in HTTP.
                2.READ :
                          1.read operation is used for retrieve the data and view the data.
                          2.In read operation you cant able to modify the data.
                          3.for read operation we have to use get method in http.

                3.UPDATE:
                          1.update operation is used for updating the existing file.
                          2.In update operation you can able to update the all the details in data and you can able change the particular detail in data.
                          3.we have to use put method to update all the data 
                          4.patch method is used for updating the particular  detail in data.

                4.DELETE:
                         1.delete operation is used for delete the data which you dont want .
                         2. for performing delete operation we have to use delete method in http.
                        

                These are the crud operations and without this operations we cant able to build a proper software application.

#### V8 ENGINE:
                1. It's  a C++-based open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google in 2008.

                2.It provides a runtime environment for the execution of JavaScript code.
        
 These are the topics that i have learned like how the crud operations works and what is nodejs and v8 engine.

 After this my mentor told me the topics http,server,internet, port, url to study .


 #### HTTP:
         1.HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol.
         2.It enabling the transfer of data between the client and server.
         3.Its provides standard between web browser and server to establish communication.
         4.Its has set of rules for transferring data from one computer to another.
         5.advantages of http:

                     1.Works on any operating system.
                     2.Compatible with various protocols and technologies.
                     3.Supports encryption for secure data transfer.
                     
         6.Disadvantages:

                      1.slow for large data transfers.
                      2.Lack of security.
