My first day as an intern at Surfboard was an exciting and memorable experience. It felt like a wonderful day to begin my career. I had the chance to meet my mentor, Kowsik, who would be guiding me through the internship program.

He is very  friendly, making me feel comfortable right from the start.He also introduced us to the principles of problem-solving. This was the core part of the session, as problem-solving is a critical skill in any professional setting. Kowsik explained that every problem has a solution, but the way we approach it makes all the difference. He broke down problem-solving into clear steps: identifying the problem, analyzing it, coming up with possible solutions, testing those solutions, and then choosing the best one. 

After the session, we had an interesting debate. The topic was, "What would you do if you had 100 crores?" This was a fun and engaging activity, allowing everyone to express their thoughts and ideas. Some of my fellow interns talked about investing the money wisely, while others focused on using it for personal development, business ventures, or helping society through charitable causes. It was fascinating to hear everyone's different perspectives. 

Throughout the day, I also got the chance to meet new people and interact with them. It was nice to connect with fellow interns who were also new to the company. We shared our backgrounds, experiences, and excitement for the program ahead. In addition to meeting the interns, I got insights into how the company works.

joel bro  shared the workflow of Surfboard, giving us a glimpse of how projects are managed, tasks are assigned, and deadlines are met. They spoke about the importance of teamwork, communication, and time management, which are key to succeeding in any professional environment. In internship class i learned about T shape horizontal and v shape structure .

t-shape structure which means he will know all the skills but he doesnt have  strong knowledge in one skill and same goes for horizontal .for v shape structure which means person have strong knowledge in one skills and also have good knowledge in other skills which he knows.

overall my first day internship at surfboard payments went well.
